# SuperNinePin Controller Adaptor

Converts a Super Nintendo controller to an Amiga/Commodore 64 controller, using digital logic. (none of this microcontroller nonsense)

### Why do such a thing? 

It's easy to throw a microcontroller at everything, and it ocurred to me I haven't done much useful in pure digital logic with the lowest possible IC count. So this is just for the fun of doing it, and also it's quite a fitting project for a 'vintage' use case.
